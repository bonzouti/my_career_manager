My Career Manager helps you organize your job search by keeping track of your job applications. https://mycareermanager.herokuapp.com

### Your dashboard

Create your account and access your dashboard. Any phone interview, interview or follow-up planned yet? They will appear in the column on the left called "Next steps" as a reminder. 

You'll be able to add an application in the column of your choice. Is it just an identified opportunity? It'll go in the first column. You've already applied, and you're waiting for the recruiter to contact you for the first time? It'll go in the second column. Already got an interview or more planned? Third column. You can add an application by clicking on the dedicated link in the navbar or directly on the button in each column's header.

When adding and saving an application, only the company, job title and step (identified, applied or in progress) are mandatory fields, but you can also copy paste the link to the job offer and/or its content if you wish to be more specific.

Access your user profile and edit your information by clicking on your email address >> my profile in the navbar. 

### Application page

View or edit the application of your choice by clicking directly on its card from the dashboard. It will take you to your application's page. There, you'll be able to add/edit job details, contact details, and notes relevant to your application.

From your application's page, you'll also be able to add a step, to validate it with the checkbox when it's completed. Steps that are done will appear under "steps done" and past steps will also be added as a line in your application's notes in case you'd want to write anything related to that particular meeting or experience.

### Archive applications

If you wish to archive an application, click on "Archive" at the bottom of your application's page. You can access all archived applications by going to your profile and clicking on "Archived applications". From there, you can view them once again and delete them permanently.

Click on any next step appearing on the dashboard's left column to display the corresponding application.

### Admin functionalities

For admins only: click on "Admin Dashboard" in the navbar. From there, you'll access key info about the web app (number of users, total number of applications, etc.) and you'll be able to view users' detailed activity and eventually delete them if necessary. 

We wish you a pleasant, organized job search with My Career Manager. More importantly, have fun!
